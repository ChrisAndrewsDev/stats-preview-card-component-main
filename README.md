## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass



### What I learned

This deceptively simple project tripped me up in a few places, and I still feel my solution isn't exactly spot-on. 
I have most definately had some issues with the box-model when trying to build responsivley! 



### Continued development

- The nitty-gritty of CSS layout and little tricks to make things fit nicely!
- Generally planning out my projects in a more logical sense
